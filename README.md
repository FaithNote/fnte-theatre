# Faithnote Theatre
<p>Source code of the replicated Flipnote Hatena website designed for Faithnote Theatre. It will be made with <b>Python 3, HTML and CSS.</b></p>
<p>This is a WIP, as not everything is added to the database yet.</p>

<h2>Running the source code</h2>
<h3>With Heroku</h3>
<p>TBA</p>
<h3>With Playit (Linux VM portforward)</h3>
<p>TBA</p>
<h3>By importing to a custom, registered domain</h3>
<p>It depends on the domain and how to import the code, but usually, you just...</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the code from "Releases"</li>
<li>Unzip the file</li>
<li>Import the code to the site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, Faithnote will have a ".xyz" domain, just like my (TC's) other revival project called <a href="https://github.com/TCScrov">Scrover.</a></li>
<li>In response, Faithnote MAY have the <b>Flipnote Stars Parther Program</b>, which has more benefits when accessing Faithnote AND the ability to make money on top on your selective Faithnote creations.</li> 
</ul>
<p>(think of the <b>YT Parther Program</b> but <b>LESS RESTRICTIONS</b>)</p>
